Overview
This Python script is designed to extract and save specific HTML content from web pages listed in a sitemap. It automates the process of fetching web content, parsing the relevant sections, and saving the extracted content into text files. The tool is ideal for tasks such as content archiving, web scraping, and data extraction from websites with structured content.

Features
Sitemap Parsing:
The script extracts URLs from an XML sitemap, making it easy to process multiple pages without manual input.
HTML Content Extraction:
It fetches the HTML content of each URL and isolates specific sections based on a predefined structure.
Unwanted Content Removal:
Unnecessary parts of the content can be identified and excluded.
File Management:
Extracted content is saved into a designated folder with sanitized filenames to avoid issues with invalid characters.
Error Handling:
Built-in error handling ensures that issues like connectivity problems or missing sections do not halt the script.
How to Use
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
The following Python libraries:
os (standard library)
requests
bs4 (BeautifulSoup from beautifulsoup4)
urllib
Install the required libraries using:

bash
Kodu kopyala
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
2. Setup
Sitemap URL:

Replace the placeholder https://example.com/sitemap.xml with the URL of the XML sitemap for the website you want to scrape.
Output Folder:

The script will save the extracted content into a folder named extracted_html. You can modify the folder name in the output_folder variable.
3. Run the Script
Execute the script by running:

bash

python extractor.py

4. Output
The extracted HTML content will be saved in .txt files within the specified output folder.
Each file will be named based on the URL path, sanitized to ensure compatibility with the file system.
Customization
Target Content Section:

Update the class name 'content' in this line:
python

content_section = soup.find('section', class_='content')
to match the structure of the target website.
Unwanted Content:

Modify the filtering logic here:
python

unwanted_text = content_section.find(string=lambda text: "Example Placeholder" in text if text else False)
to exclude specific text or sections.
Output Format:

Change the output format (e.g., .html, .json) by altering the open statement in:
python

with open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    file.write(html_content)
Example Use Case
Suppose you want to extract blog posts from a website that lists them in an XML sitemap.
Replace the sitemap URL in the script with the actual sitemap link.
Run the script. The tool will:
Fetch each blog post's URL from the sitemap.
Extract the main content section.
Save the content into text files for further use.
Potential Enhancements
Add support for JSON or CSV output formats.
Implement multi-threading for faster processing of large sitemaps.
Include logging for better debugging and progress tracking.
Extend the script to handle pagination within websites.
This tool is versatile and can be adapted to various web scraping and content extraction tasks.
